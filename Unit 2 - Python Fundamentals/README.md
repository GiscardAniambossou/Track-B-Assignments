# Unit 2: Python Programming Fundamentals

Students will begin to explore Python 3.  
Python is high level, general purpose programming language – used in application and web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and more.  
This until will expose students to the fundamentals of using Python – setting the stage for more advanced data analytics topics.

## Some topics this unit will cover: 
+ Variable assignments and data types
+ Data Structure: Lists, Dictionaries, Sets, Tuple
+ Conditional Operations: If Statements, else, elif
+ Logical Operations: AND, OR, NOT Functions
+ Built-in Functions and Custom Functions

## Outcomes of this unit:
+ A solid foundation of Python Programming fundamentals
+ Start using Python as a primary data analysis programming language
+ How to loop through a dataset and perform different tasks
+ Create, use, and understand why functions are useful and necessary for programming.

## Projects:
In addition to multiple assignments that provide practice on core concepts, students will be engaged in projects that develop their skills using functions and looping through datasets.
