# Unit 3: Data Analytics & Descriptive Statistics in Python

Building on the topics learned in the previous units, students will dive deeper into data analysis and statistics using Python.  
Students will be importing data from multiples sources, including excel and csv files.  
Students will explore real-world business cases using popular and relevant scientific data analysis libraries. 

## Some topics this unit will cover: 
+ NumPy
+ Pandas
+ Matplotlib, Seaborn
+ Data wrangling 
+ Regression

## Outcomes of this unit:
+ Use NumPy and Pandas to gather data from various sources (excel, csv, etc.), and clean and transform that data.
+ Create visualizations to communicate findings in Matplotlib, Seaborn, and other visualization tools.
+ Understand hypothesis testing and how it’s used in solving business use cases.

## Projects: 
+ Analyze Covid-19 dataset and gain insights from underlying data
+ Perform stock data analysis using various data analysis libraries
+ Perform analysis on CDC data to answer questions such as: does the data show significant evidence that certain demographic groups are more prone to diabetes? How and does diabetes impact the length of stay in a hospital?
+ Perform analysis on various tasks and activities performed by a data analyst professional and summarize the analysis
